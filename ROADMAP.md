# 🗺️ Axonium Roadmap

## What's Next?

Honestly? We don't have a fixed roadmap yet — and that's intentional.

Axonium is shaped by the people who use it. We'd rather build features you actually want than guess what might be useful.

## 💬 We Want Your Ideas!

This is where you come in. Tell us:
- What's missing?
- What would make Axonium better for you?
- What annoys you in other browsers?

👉 [Submit a feature request](../../issues/new?template=feature_request.md)

Every suggestion is read and considered. The best ideas will end up here and eventually in the app.
